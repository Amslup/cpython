Change `Py_TRASHCAN_BEGIN()` to automatically call `PyObject_GC_UnTrack()`.
Previously, the untrack function must be explicitly called before
`Py_TRASHCAN_BEGIN()`. There have been a number of bugs over the years
related to not doing this particular dance just right.  This change makes it
harder to do things incorrectly.  That avoids some hard to find bugs (e.g.
only triggered when object nesting gets deep enough). Extensions that still
call `PyObject_GC_UnTrack()` explictly will still work correctly but the
call is redundant after this change.  It would still be needed for the
extension to work correctly with both older and newer versions of Python.
