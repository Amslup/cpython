:meth:`concurrent.futures.Executor.map` no longer eagerly creates all futures prior to yielding any
results. This allows it to work with huge or infinite :term:`iterable` without
consuming excessive resources or crashing, making it more suitable as a drop
in replacement for the built-in :func:`map`. Patch by Josh Rosenberg.
